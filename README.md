## The Problem

You're running a company with AI agents — research, engineering, deals, treasury. But right now you're juggling:

| Without Shipyard | With Shipyard |
|:---|:---|
| Scattered agent outputs across Telegram, Slack, email | One dashboard, all agents, all activity |
| No idea what your agents are working on | Kanban board that updates in real time |
| Manually kicking off agent tasks | Drag to "In Progress" → agent activates |
| No cost visibility until the bill arrives | Per-agent budgets with approval gates |
| Copy-pasting context between tools | Agents share memory, goals, and workspace |

<br />

## ✨ Features

### 🗂 Kanban Task Board
Drag a task to "In Progress" and your agent picks it up. When it's done, the task moves to "Done" automatically. Budget checks and approval gates built in.

### 🤖 Agent Team Management
Five specialized agents out of the box — Chief of Staff, Scout (research), Builder (engineering), Deal Flow (partnerships), Baron (treasury). Add your own with custom roles, skills, and accent colors.

### 📊 Dashboard Command Center
Morning briefing in one glance: agent status (live pulsing dots), task summary, project health, recent intel, inbox, and goals — all on one screen.

### 💰 Budget Enforcement
Set monthly spend limits per agent. Shipyard checks budgets before activation and warns you when agents approach their limits. No surprise bills.

### 📂 GitHub Projects
CI status, open PRs, and deploy health for your pinned repos. Color-coded badges update automatically.

### 🔭 Intel Feed
Market intelligence reports from your Scout agent. Deploy research runs from the dashboard.

### 📅 Calendar & Inbox
Google Calendar events and important emails surfaced automatically. No more tab-switching.

### 🧠 Agent Memory
Browse your agents' memory files, daily notes, and long-term context. Everything is transparent.

### 💬 Agent Chat
Talk directly to your agents from the dashboard. Ask questions, give instructions, get status updates.

### 📱 Mobile Ready
Responsive design with bottom navigation. Manage your agent team from your phone.

<br />

## 🚀 Quickstart

### One command:

```bash
npx create-shipyard-app
```

This will:
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Launch the setup wizard
4. Open your browser

### Or manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BiscayneDev/shipyard-os.git
cd shipyard-os
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — the setup wizard walks you through connecting your agents.

### With Ollama (local models):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BiscayneDev/shipyard-os.git
cd shipyard-os
npm install
npm run dev
```

In the setup wizard, choose **"Ollama / Local Models"** and point it at your running Ollama instance. Works with LM Studio and llama.cpp too — anything that speaks the Ollama API.

### Demo mode

Don't have agents set up yet? No problem. Click **"Skip — explore without agents"** in the setup wizard to get a feel for the dashboard with sample data.

```

1. **You drag a task** to "In Progress"
2. **Budget check** runs — does this agent have spend remaining?
3. **Approval gate** shows you the cost estimate — confirm or cancel
4. **Agent activates** via OpenClaw gateway
5. **Task auto-moves** to "Done" when the agent finishes
6. **Toast notification** fires — activity logged to the feed

No polling. No manual follow-up. The board is the source of truth.

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need OpenClaw to use this?</strong></summary>
<br />
No! Shipyard OS supports multiple runtimes: OpenClaw for full agent orchestration, Ollama/LM Studio/llama.cpp for local models, or demo mode to explore without any runtime.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this just a dashboard?</strong></summary>
<br />
No — it's an operating system. When you drag a task to "In Progress", it actually fires an agent. Budget gates prevent runaway costs. The board reflects what your agents are doing in real time.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use my own agents instead of the defaults?</strong></summary>
<br />
Yes. Add, edit, or delete agents from the Agents page. Each agent is a markdown identity file in your workspace — fully customizable roles, skills, and personalities.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about costs?</strong></summary>
<br />
Shipyard OS tracks per-agent token usage via the Anthropic Admin API. Set monthly budgets per agent, and the system will block activation when limits are reached. No surprise bills.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I self-host this?</strong></summary>
<br />
Yes. It's a standard Next.js app. Run it locally, deploy to Vercel, or host anywhere that supports Node.js. Task storage uses local JSON in dev and Vercel KV in production.
